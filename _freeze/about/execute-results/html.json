PsychGen aims to increase our knowledge about how genes and environmental factors influence the development and progression of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions throughout the lifespan. Our goal is to build knowledge with potential to improve prevention, early intervention, and treatment strategies, and ultimately lead to improved mental health outcomes for individuals and communities.\n\nTo learn more about the PsychGen center: <https://www.fhi.no/en/me/the-psychgen-centre-for-genetic-epidemiology-and-mental-health/>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
